# Docker support for Multiplayer Sample

The O3DE Multiplayer Sample supports construction of Docker images on the Linux environment. 

## Prerequisites

* [Hardware requirements of o3de](https://www.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/requirements/)
* Any Linux distribution that supports Docker and the NVIDIA container toolkit (see below)
 * **Note** For the headless server flavor, the NVIDIA container toolkit is not required.
* At least 60 GB of free disk space
* Docker installed and configured
  * **Note** It is recommended to have Docker installed correctly and in a secure manner so that the Docker commands in this guide do not require elevated priviledges (sudo) in order to run them. See [Docker Engine post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) for more details.
* [NVidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)

# Building the Docker image
The Docker scripts accepts arguments to control how to build the Docker image for the Multiplayer Sample. The main argument, `PACKAGE_TYPE` controls the type of launcher that will be built from the Docker build process. There are four different types of launchers supported:

1. **game** : The game client that will connect to a game server.
2. **server** : The game server that will accept remote game clients and will also provide a display of running game sessions. 
3. **unified** : The combined game client that also can run as the game server.
4. **headless** : The game server that will accept remote game clients but will not display and GUI or window. This is launcher is designed to run on headless servers.

In addition to `PACKAGE_TYPE`, there are additional arguments that can control how the Docker image is built:

| Argument                | Description                                                                | Default

## Examples

### Locally (From the o3de-multiplayersample/Docker folder)
The following examples will be the different supported types of launchers using the local Docker context folder in the `o3de-multiplayersample` local repo.

#### Game Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=game -f Dockerfile -t amd64/o3de-mps-game:jammy .
```
#### Unified Game Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=unified -f Dockerfile -t amd64/o3de-mps-unified:jammy .
```
#### Server Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=server -f Dockerfile -t amd64/o3de-mps-server:jammy .
```
#### Headless Server Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=headless -f Dockerfile -t amd64/o3de-mps-headless:jammy .
```

### From github
The following examples will be the different supported types of launchers using the Docker context found in the github repo for `o3de-multiplayersample` and the `development` branch.

#### Game Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=game -t amd64/o3de-mps-game:jammy https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample.git#development:Docker
```
#### Unified Game Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=unified -t amd64/o3de-mps-unified:jammy https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample.git#development:Docker
```
#### Server Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=server -t amd64/o3de-mps-server:jammy https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample.git#development:Docker
```
#### Headless Server Launcher
```
docker build --build-arg PACKAGE_TYPE=headless -t amd64/o3de-mps-headless:jammy https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample.git#development:Docker
```


# Running the Docker image locally
Running the non-headless Docker images requires Vulkan and GPU acceleration provided by the NVIDIA drivers and container toolkit. The following directions will describe how to launch the Docker containers, utilizing the host Linux machine's X11 display and NVIDIA drivers, and connecting to the default 'bridge' network. (For advanced network isolation, refer to Docker's command-line reference for [network](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#network))



#### Game Launcher
```
xhost +local:root
docker run --rm --gpus all -e DISPLAY=:1 --network="bridge" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -it amd64/o3de-mps-game:jammy
```
#### Unified Game Launcher
```
xhost +local:root
docker run --rm --gpus all -e DISPLAY=:1 --network="bridge" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -it amd64/o3de-mps-unified:jammy
```
#### Server Launcher
```
xhost +local:root
docker run --rm --gpus all -e DISPLAY=:1 --network="bridge" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -it amd64/o3de-mps-server:jammy
```
#### Headless Server Launcher
```
docker run --network="bridge" -it amd64/o3de-mps-headless:jammy
```
>**Note** Headless server does not require access to the host display or NVIDIA drivers



# Deploying the Docker image
The Docker image can be published to any docker container registry and deployed on any Linux operating system that supports Docker.
